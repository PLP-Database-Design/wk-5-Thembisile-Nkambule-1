## Project Overview

**System Under Test:** Word Puzzle Game Plus  
**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Environment:** Chrome Browser (Desktop)

### Features Under Test

| Feature | Description | Risk Category |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Reset Game | Clears score and progress instantly |High - can lead to data loss |
| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage |Medium-incorrect ranking affects user trust but doesn‚Äôt break gameplay|
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles ‚Üí doubles score | Medum - logic error|

## Test Plan

### Objectives
- Functional Testing - Verify that the word scrambling mechanism functions correctly, the scoring system follows defined rules and the hint, reset button and leaderboard update as expected.
- User Interface Testing - Verify that all UI elements (buttons, input fields, score display etc.) are visible, aligned and responsive across different screen sizes.
- Game Principle Testing - Ensure random word selection is functioning correctly, scrambled words differ from original words and scoring (including bonus points) is applied accurately.
- User Experience Testing - Validate that the hint system is helpful and concise, the leaderboard is clearly displayed and the game provides immediate, understandable feedback for user actions.


### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Reset game logic and score clearing.
- Leaderboard storage, sorting, and persistence.
- Bonus round score-doubling mechanism.
- Word scrambling, guessing, and hint system.
- Score calculation and progression tracking.

**Out of Scope:**
- Performance and load testing.
- Cross-browser compatibility beyond Chrome
- Mobile responsiveness

### Tools & Resources
- Roles- Test Manager,  Risk Analyst, Test Executor.
- Tools- Github projects and issues, Google chrome, Snipping tool (for screenshots), Vs code
